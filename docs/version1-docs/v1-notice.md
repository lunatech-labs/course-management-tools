## Notice

You're navigating the documentation of the first version (V1)
of the Course Management Tools.

This version has been superceded by version 2 which has a number of
important advantages compared to V1:

- It's build tool agnostic
- It's doesn't require a specific main repository structure

If you start a new project, use CMT version 2
