## Main administration tasks

The `cmt-mainadm` command can be invoked in two ways:

- _init_ command mode: this allows creating a new CMT master repository
  based on one of the CMT master templates. See section for more information, read
  the ["Starting from a CMT master template"](v1-your-first-project.md#starting-from-a-cmt-master-template) section.
- admin mode. This chapter focuses on this mode.

Depending on the action specified, the following options may apply:

### `-dot`: Dotty compatible build definition

With this option, the Scala version is assumed to be set exactly in the
`Version.scalaVersion` variable in your build definition. If this is not
the case, you will set the sbt build's `scalaVersion` settings elsewhere.

### `-nar`: Do not automatically reload the build on build changes

This option is used to overrule the default behavior which is to
automatically reload the build when a change in the build definition
is detected by sbt.

## Deleting an exercise

The following command will delete the exercise with number `n` from the main
course repository and re-generate the root `build.sbt` file:

```
$ cmt-mainadm -d <n> [-cfg config_file] [-dot] [-nar] <main_repo>
```

## Duplicate a given exercise and insert it before that exercise

The following command will duplicate the exercise with number `n`.
The duplicate will retain the number of the exercise that is duplicated
while the latter and subsequent exercises to be shifted "down".

```
$ cmt-mainadm -dib <n> [-cfg config_file] [-dot] [-nar] <main_repo>
``` 

For example, imagine a CMT main repository with a list of exercises with
exercise numbers increasing by 1. The following table shows the before
and after when running the `cmt-mainadm -dib 3 ...` command:

![DIB exercise # 3 - no gap](https://i.imgur.com/oSp1KXY.png)

If there is "space" to insert the duplicate, no renumbering will occur as
the before and after shows when running the `cmt-mainadm -dib 6 ...` command:

![DIB exercise # 3 - gap](https://i.imgur.com/CYJafQH.png)

## Renumber exercises with a given offset and step size

In some situations, it can be useful to renumber the exercises in a CMT main
repository. Perhaps you want to create a "gap" in which some new exercises
will be put, or you want to shift all exercises to some offset.

This can be achieved with the _renumber_ option on `cmt-mainadm`.

Here are a couple of examples with a before and after situation.

Running `cmt-mainadm -r -rs 5 -ro 10 ...`

![Renumber with non-default offset and stepsize](https://i.imgur.com/pm7m6f9.png)

Running `cmt-mainadm -r -rs 11 ...`

Running `cmt-mainadm -r -ro 10 ...`

## Generation of a repository test script

In the course of the life-time of a CMT project, the exercise series most
probably will change quite a bit by changing exercises, moving them around,
deleting and adding exercises and you may want to switch to a new version of
the CMT tools when it becomes available.

You want to make sure that your project is still running fine: the code
compiles without errors and all tests pass for _**each and every**_ exercise.
Verifying this manually is tedious and error prone.

The alternative is to automate the process and this can be done with the
help of `cmt-mainadm -t ...`

Running:

```
cmt-mainadm -t <some_test_file> [-cfg config_file] [-dot] [-nar] <main_repo>
```

will generate a script (with the file name passed as an argument to the `-t` option)
that, when executed, will run the following steps:

- for each of the exercises in the main repository:
  - compile the exercise code
  - run the exercise tests
  - run the `man e` command
- it _linearizes_ the main repository and it executes the test on the _last_
exercise (at the HEAD of the **_git_** repo)
- it _studentifies_ the main repository and in this repository, it runs
  through _all_ the exercises in a random manner and for each of these
  exercise it:
  - jumps to that exercise
  - pulls the solution
  - runs the tests
  - saves the state
  - lists the saved states
  - restores the saved state

Ideally, you should set-up CI/CD to perform this test process on each PR and
PR merge. For inspiration, you may want to have a look at
[the way this is done](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
via Github Actions in the Lunatech Labs [Moving from Scala 2 to Scala 3 Github
course](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course).

> **NOTE**<br>
> When the `-g` option is added when invoking `cmt-mainadm -t`, the generated
> test script will pass `-g` on invocations of `cmt-studentify` in the script.
> The reason why one might want to do this is to test studentified 
> artifacts initialized as a **_git_** repository.

## Checking the soundness of a CMT main repository

A CMT main repository has to be built according to a number of conventions.
When building a new course, it may be difficult to check if all these 
conventions are followed. `cmt-mainadm`'s _check main repository soundness_
feature allows one to run a check of most of these conventions and report
any discrepancies.

The following checks are made:

- Presence of a global course instruction file (`README.md`)
- Presence of exercise instruction files (`README.md`) for all exercises
- Presence of a course name file (`.courseName`)
- Presence of a number of files in the sbt build definition:
  - `CommonSettings.scala`
  - `AdditionalSettings.scala`
  - `CompileOptions.scala`
  - `Dependencies.scala`
  - `build.properties`
- Presence of the following files in the sbt build definition (note that in
  some use cases however, these files may not be present):
  - `Man.scala`
  - `Navigation.scala`
  - `MPSelection.scala`
  - `StudentCommandsPlugin.scala`
  - `StudentKeys.scala`
- Presence of a `common` project source folder in your build (unless your
  project has a configuration that disables a `common` project).

Here's an example of a run of `cmt-mainadm -c` that reports no problems:

```
$ cmt-mainadm -c /Users/ericloots/Trainingen/LBT/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course
git version 2.28.0
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

## Rebuild the root `build.sbt` of a CMT main repository

Whenever manual changes are made to the exercise names in the main repository,
the sbt build definition must be adapted to reflect this change. It is
recommended to use `cmt-mainadm` to do this and it is done with the following
command:

```
$ cmt-mainadm -b [-cfg config_file] [-dot] [-nar] <main_repo>
```

It is recommended to utilise this option only when other feaures of
`cmt-mainadm` cannot solve the task at hand. For example, this is the
case when the name of an exercise is changed (e.g. from, say
`exercise_007_given` to `exercise_007_given_keyword`)

## Wrapping up

It is worthwhile to give an example of specifying a non-default CMT
configuration file to round up this section. You may have to do this
in your CMT project if you put the `course-management.conf` file in a
non-default location or when you give it a different name.

For the example, we use the CMT Github repository itself and we will
run `cmt-mainadm -c` on the templates. Here is a sample run:

```
$ cmt-mainadm -c \
              -cfg course-templates/scala-cmt-template-common/course-management.conf \
              /Users/ericloots/Trainingen/LBT/course-management-tools
git version 2.28.0
