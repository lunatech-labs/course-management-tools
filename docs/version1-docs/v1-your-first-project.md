## Starting from a CMT master template

> NOTE: You're browsing an older version of the tooling. You can find the docs of the current version [here](../your-first-project.md).

### Introduction

The Course Management Tools come with a number of templates. The available
templates can be listed via `cmt-mainadm init -l` as shown here:

```
$ cmt-mainadm init -l
[0] dotty-cmt-template-common
[1] dotty-cmt-template-no-common
[2] play-cmt-template-no-common
[3] scala-cmt-template-common
[4] scala-cmt-template-no-common
``` 

So, at the time we ran the above command, 5 CMT templates were available: 2 for 
[Dotty](https://dotty.epfl.ch) projects, 2 for [Scala](https://scala-lang.org) and
one for a [Play](https://www.playframework.com) project.

> NOTE
> As you can see, suffix of the template names is either _"common"_ or _"no_common"_.
> If you have no idea what this means, start with the version ending in _"no_common"_.

These templates are tested and valid CMT master repositories. Each of them contain
just 2 exercises. They can be cloned as explained later in this section and
subsequently adapted to your needs.

During the cloning process, we can adapt the name of the course and decide on where
the clone will be created by specifying a target directory.

Cloning can be done in interactive- or non-interactive mode. Of course, in both cases,
you'll need the name of a template. So, first run `cmt-mainadm init -l` to get an
up-to-date list of CMT templates.

Let's have a look at interactive and [non-interactive mode](#non-interactive-mode).

### Interactive mode

When running `cmt-mainadm init`, we automatically enter the interactive mode. This will
prompt us for the parameters. The CMT template name, the name we want to assign to the
cloned course, and the [base] target directory. After successful completion of the 
command, a folder with the name of the course. The name is converted to all lowercase
characters and any spaces in the name swapped to dashes (`-`)).

Let's see how this works in a trial run:

```
$ cmt-mainadm init -l
[0] dotty-cmt-template-common
[1] dotty-cmt-template-no-common
[2] play-cmt-template-no-common
[3] scala-cmt-template-common
[4] scala-cmt-template-no-common

$ cmt-mainadm init

```
<br>
A few things to note from the above output:

- We see that the name of the project, _Starting with Scala_ is reflected
  in:
  - the name of the cloned CMT template: _starting-with-scala_
  - the sbt prompt: (man [e] > **Starting with Scala** > initial state >_
- Running the sbt `projects` command shows us that there are two exercises. We
  see that the name of the exercises has been "tuned" with a _step_ prefix
- The tests are run on the first exercise (named _step_000_initial_state_) by
  running the sbt `test` command
- We switch to the second exercise by running the sbt
  `project step_001_add_multiplication` command and run the tests by running
   the sbt `test` command

### _Studentifying_ your first project

With the cloned project in place, we can now _studentify_ it and try out some of
the functionality of the _studentified_ repository. We will create the _studentified_
repository in the `/Users/ericloots/tmp/stu` folder:

```
$ cmt-studentify -dot /Users/ericloots/tmp/starting-with-scala /Users/ericloots/tmp/stu
CHECKING WORKSPACE in /Users/ericloots/tmp/starting-with-scala
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/var/folders/rq/vhwkgm9x2rs33jl4t2x6t6jr0000gn/T/sbt_6a77e07a/starting-with-scala.git/

 * [new branch]      HEAD -> 5E8824BB-46D7-4246-8D8F-9981934B1D67
Cloning into 'starting-with-scala'...
done.
Processing exercises:
    step_000_initial_state
    step_001_add_multiplication

Setting student repository bookmark to step_000_initial_state

```

The _studentified_ repository is an sbt build with a number of extra custom commands:

- `listExercises`
- `man` and `man e` to display the global project README file and the exercise
  instructions respectively
- Moving around between exercises:
  - `nextExercise` and `prevExercise`: move to the next or previous exercise respectively.
  - `gotoExercise <exercise_name>`. Basically the same as `nextExercise`, but allowing
  an move to a specific exercise
  - `gotoFirstExercise`. Jump to the first exercise in the course
    - All the above commands share a common property: they will pull in the test code
      for the "selected" exercise. Any other code that was present prior to executing
      the command is left unchanged
- `pulSolution` will "pull" the solution for the current exercise. Note that this will
  overwrite any code present in the current exercise.
- `saveState` will "checkpoint" the current state (code) for the current exercise. An
  exercise's state can be saved as many time as desired, but only the last saved state
  is retained
- `savedStates` will list any previously saved states
- `restoreState <saved state>`. Will restore the state of a previously saved state
  of an exercise. Note that this command will automatically reposition the current
  exercise to the restored one 


Let's give this a spin by switching to the _linearized_ repository and fire-up sbt
in its root folder.

```
$ cd /Users/ericloots/tmp/stu/starting-with-scala

# Basic Scala CMT master master project

## Description

This project can be used as a template for a master
project managed by the [Course Management Tools](https://github.com/eloots/course-management-tools)

It contains 2 simple steps (or exercises)

```
<br>
Ok, we see the two exercises, with the current exercise set to `step_000_initial_state`.
We also ran the `man` command to display the main README file.

Let's display the exercise instructions for the current exercise and run the tests for
that exercise.

```
# Initial state - basic addition

## Introduction

- Add basic addition in object Math
- Adds a main method

[success] Total time: 3 s, completed 11 Aug 2020, 10:55:17
```
<br>
We can now move to the next exercise by issuing the `nextExercise` command. To
demonstrate that we pull in the test code for the second exercise, but not the
solution, we will run the tests and witness that compilation errors are reported
as the solution code is missing:

```
man [e] > Starting with Scala > initial state > nextExercise
[INFO] Moved to step_001_add_multiplication

man [e] > Starting with Scala > add multiplication > man e
# Add multiplication

## Background

- Add multiplication to object Math

Of course, in a class room setting, the student's task would add the code required to
make the tests pass. For the sake of demonstration, we will simply "pull" that code
and run the tests again:

```
man [e] > Starting with Scala > add multiplication > pullSolution
[INFO] Solution for exercise step_001_add_multiplication pulled successfully
man [e] > Starting with Scala > add multiplication > test

[success] Total time: 1 s, completed 11 Aug 2020, 11:00:51
man [e] > Starting with Scala > add multiplication >
``` 
<br>
As expected, the test now pass.

We will finish of by demonstrating the `saveState`, `savedStates`, and `restoreState`
commands.

```

### Non-interactive mode

We can create a clone of the CMT master template in non-interactive mode by
specifying the required parameters on the command line as shown here:

```
