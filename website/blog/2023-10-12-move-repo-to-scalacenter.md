## Moving CMT to the Scala Center organisation

After launching version 2 of the Course Management Tools (CMT) in July 2023, I'm very happy to announce that the Scala Center has accepted my request to host the CMT project on its GitHub organisation. Here's why I requested the transfer:

- I want the open source community to stay in control of the CMT project which aligns with the Scala Center's mission;
- CMT is useful to the anyone who needs to create and maintain course exercises, independently of the programming language or build tool used. By being hosted by the Scala Center, its visibility to potential users is likely to increase;
- Increased visibility will probably lead to more feedback about ways to enhance the tools which will be beneficial to everyone;
- Last but not least, CMT was written in Scala 3, which makes the Scala Center a natural choice to host the tools.

As for myself, I will continue to maintain and enhance CMT after the transfer and I already have a list of new features that I plan to add after the transfer.

A big thanks to the Scala Center!
